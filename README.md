# Udacity-Program-1-US-Bike-Share

this project is a part of Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program.
it's the first project out of 2 projects.
you have to unzip "udacity bike data.zip" file and all 4 files (1 [.py] and 3 [.csv]) are in the same folder 

In this project, we will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington
the data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States

# The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

We'll ask the user to enter the city (must) , month and day of week (optional) to copmute the statistics.

# Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  -most common month

  -most common day of week

  -most common hour of day



#2 Popular stations and trip
  -most common start station
  -most common end station
  -most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
  -total travel time
  -average travel time

#4 User info
  -counts of each user type
  -counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  -earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  
#5 Raw data
  -we will ask the user if he wants to see some raw data from the dataset
